## Installation 
You need to install shitton of libraries for such small bot.
Assuming you have installed nothing, paste this command to install everything you need.
```
python3 setup.py install
```
In case something didn't install, contact me through Discord: Europer#5312 or alternatively use StackOverflow if I'm not responding.

## Setting up
After you installed 100500 packages we need to get necessary information
for this bot to make it work. First off, you have to recall your login and password, then
you need to get the so-called Client ID, Client Secret and the TwitchAPI itself.
You have to go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console and get every piece of data from there.

After this ^^ popped up and you entered Twitch data, then you are free to go to give it X, Y coordinates
and color name in HEX values. Now you are ready to smash this pixel battle!
